## 1. ROV - Mechanical
1. Should we re-use the current plastic frame? Could we make any improvements?
2. Is replacing the sagging thruster mounts necessary?
3. Better ways to gain access to the internal electronics? Taking the waterproof cover on and off takes some time.
4. Robot arms - Are we required to create arms from scratch, or can we purchase off-the-shelf products and attach to the mainframe?

## 2. ROV - Electrical
1. The current wiring setup is very disorganized. Should we design our own, streamlined PCB? If we do so, would a frame / acrylic enclosure design change be necessary?
2. Would it be beneficial to adopt a more powerful microcontroller (e.g. STmirco or ARM, rather than ATmega) for advanced control?
3. When are we gaining access to the schematics of the circuits?
   
## 3. ROV - Software
1. How do we interface with the robot? What pieces of software are used to control the ROV? Do we use an RC controller?
2. How is the camera feedback relayed to the controller?
3. How do we upload software to the ROV? Any cables / adapters / software / drivers for doing so?
4. (related to 2-2) What microcontroller is used to control the robot?
5. Previous competition guidelines feature a 3-D scanning objective. How do we implement this?

## 4. ROV - Piloting 
1. Where can we practice controlling and using the robot? Indoor pools? School pool?
2. Any simulator software that emulates the underwater environment and controls?
3. Who will be the pilot of the team? Can we have multiple pilots, one for the main motion, another for arm control?
4. (related to 3-1) What physical piloting interface should be used?
   
## 5. Competition
1. What exactly are the competition objectives / missions?
2. Rules and regluations pertaining to the design / capabilities of the ROV?
3. What are the marketing aspects of the competition?
4. Dress code?
5. How much time do we have to rehearse everything?

## 6. Safety & technical documents
1. What do good safety documents that score well look like? Any past examples?
2. Who will be in charge of writing the documents? Will this be a team-effort instead?
   
## 7. Logistics and manufacturing
1. How long does international shipping (specifically China) usually take?
2. Where is the fab-lab?
3. Any tools that we are missing? (check inventory)
   
## 8. Budget-related

## 9. Working on the ROV
1. Do all the group members know how to use all the necessary software for developing, designing, troubleshooting and testing the robot?
2. What are the specific software that we need?
3. Are they easily accessible? Are they free? If not, can we get a free student subscription?
